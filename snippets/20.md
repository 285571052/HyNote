How to create bar graph with categorical data
---
from : https://cn.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/329953-how-to-create-bar-graph-with-categorical-data

I would like to plot a bar graph separated in categories. I tried out the example code here from Matlab Documentation:

```matlab {.language-matlab data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="0"}
c = categorical({'apples','oranges','pears'});
prices = [1.23 0.99 2.3];
bar(c,prices);
```

But I don't get the categories displayed on the "x-Axis" of the graph, instead just int's 1-3.

Meanwhile I have found this workaround:

```matlab {.language-matlab data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="1"}
prices = [1.23 0.99 2.3];
bar(prices);
set(gca,'xticklabel',{'apples','oranges','pears'});
```
