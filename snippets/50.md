# Atom Snippets 转义字符

### Escaping Characters

Including a literal closing brace inside the text provided by a snippet's tab stop will close that tab stop early. To prevent that, escape the brace with two backslashes, like so:

```coffee
'.source.js':
  'function':
    'prefix': 'funct'
    'body': """
      ${1:function () {
        statements;
      \\}
      this line is also included in the snippet tab;
      }
      """
```

**也就是说输入`\\`表示转移开始,若要表示反斜杠那么应该是`\\\\`**
